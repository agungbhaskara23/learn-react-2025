# Learn React Programming Language and Next.js Framework

This repository includes code for learning React and Next.js. It includes some mini project which is created for comprehensive understanding. Unfortunately, this project cannot be run in Next.js Framework since the Next.js core file is not included in this repo (limitation of batch upload size).

Note: It is original by the author and prohibited to be used/copied/modified by any user (this repo created only for archiving purpose).
